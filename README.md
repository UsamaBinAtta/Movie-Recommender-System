# Movie-Recommender-System
This repository contains the code and resources for a Content-Based Movie Recommender System. The recommender system suggests movies to users based on the content features of movies they have previously enjoyed. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook for building and training the recommender system, a dataset in ZIP format, and an app.py file for deployment.
#Introduction
A Content-Based Movie Recommender System suggests movies to users by comparing the features of movies they have liked or rated in the past. This system uses attributes like genres, actors, directors, and other metadata to identify patterns and recommend similar movies.

#Files
content_based_recommender.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code for building and training the content-based recommender system.
dataset.zip: A ZIP file containing the dataset used for training and testing the recommender system.
app.py: The deployment code for the recommender system using a web application.
#Usage
Open the content_based_recommender.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to build and train the content-based recommender system.
The trained model can then be used to make movie recommendations based on user preferences.
#Deployment
The app.py file contains the deployment code for the recommender system using a web application. To deploy the application:

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (see Dependencies).
Run the app.py file using a Python interpreter.
Access the recommender system through your web browser.
